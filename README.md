# IDEAS
* typeracer and keybr are two of my favourite websites
  * so I would love to combine their concepts and apply them to learning chinese
  * make them type something with the pinyin and then get rid of the pinyin to see how they do
* need an open database of hints for every character (e.g. pronounciation clue or meaning clue)
  * this should be upvoteable
* I also want to finish Schwa, this is a goal in life

# How to render
* to render the wubi roots I need to vectorise the wubi86 keyboard with AI
  * and then I can manually extract the components with inkscape (tbh I could probably just trace them in inkscape)
  * and then I can render the SVG on command (unfortunately )
Blue characters: key character roots
Red characters: stroke-based character roots
Green characters: roots used for compound characters
Numbers at bottom: position and key information

蓝字根：键名字
Blue characters: Key name characters
红字根：笔画标识字根
Red characters: Stroke-identifying character roots
绿字根：用于繁体字
Green characters: Used for traditional characters
下方蓝字：区位,按键
Bottom blue characters: Area position, keystrokes
下方绿字：一级备码字
Bottom green characters: First-level alternative code characters


# Piano app
* also to make that piano playing app
  * for piano make the top two rows of the keyboard the white keys, and then the number for can be black keys
  * and this works pretty well because the A key can actually be A, and Enter is E which is satisfying

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
